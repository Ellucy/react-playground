# Study Project

## Rationale

The first part of the project helps you create a packing list. You can select the number of items from a dropdown list, and then specify the object(s) in an input field. After an item is added, you have the option to delete it or mark it as packed. Additionally, there's a sorting feature and the ability to delete all items in the list (with a confirmation window). As you mark items as packed, you'll receive information on the percentage of items that are packed.

The second part involves flashcards. On one side of the card, there's a question, and by clicking the card, you reveal the answer.

The third part features an accordion-style layout with collapsible content. Clicking on a section reveals a large amount of content.

The final part is the bill calculator. When you input the bill amount, a summary and a clear button will appear. You can also indicate how satisfied you and your friend were with the food. Based on the average satisfaction rating, the tip value is calculated.

These study projects are originally created by Jonas Schmedtmann in the Udemy course "The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More." In this project, I've combined different projects from the course into a single comprehensive project. Most of the HTML and CSS were designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.
